### Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations

In this project, you will use PyTorch and neural networks to predict hotel cancellations using real-world hotel booking data from a resort hotel.
The dataset contains many useful predictive input features such as:

* the date of the booking
* the length of stay
* the number of adults, children, and babies
* the average daily rates

  
Your task is to build and train two neural networks:

* a binary network to predict if a customer will cancel their booking or not
* a multiclass network to predict if a customer will show up to their booking, cancel their booking ahead of time, or no-show

  
Training a well-performing model can provide immense value to a hotel company by helping to:

* optimize revenue strategies
* better allocate resources such as staff and amenities
* assist in marketing strategies to target high-risk customers with ads and promotions
